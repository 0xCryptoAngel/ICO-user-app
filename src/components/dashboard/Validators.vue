        This launchpad will help you become a validator, so you can play an active part in Ethereum’s future. Validators are key to the more secure, scalable, and sustainable Ethereum we’re building together.

        As a validator, you’ll be responsible for securing the network and receive continuous payouts for actions that help the network reach consensus.

        Today, you’ll secure the Beacon Chain, the first main scaling upgrade. It’s a separate chain that uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Eventually you’ll help secure all of Ethereum, once mainnet (the Ethereum we use today) merges with the Beacon Chain.
        Validating in Ethereum is not the same as mining. The outcomes are similar: the work you do will extend and secure the chain. But the process is completely different because they use different consensus mechanisms.
